# Responses API Compatibility Context

## Purpose and Scope

This capability implements OpenAI-compatible behavior for `POST /v1/responses`, including request validation, streaming events, non-streaming aggregation, and OpenAI-style error envelopes. The scope is limited to what the ChatGPT upstream can provide; unsupported features are explicitly rejected.

See `openspec/specs/responses-api-compat/spec.md` for normative requirements.

## Rationale and Decisions

- **Responses as canonical wire format:** Internally we treat Responses as the source of truth to avoid divergent streaming semantics.
- **Strict validation:** Required fields and mutually exclusive fields are enforced up front to match official client expectations.
- **Cursor alias compatibility:** Cursor UI model labels may append reasoning or speed suffixes to GPT-5 slugs; those are normalized to canonical upstream fields before forwarding.
- **No truncation support:** Requests that include `truncation` are rejected because upstream does not support it.
- **Compact as a separate contract:** Standalone compact is treated as a canonical opaque context-window contract, not as a variant of buffered normal `/responses`.

## Constraints

- Upstream limitations determine available modalities, tool output, and overflow handling.
- `store=true` is rejected; responses are not persisted.
- `include` values must be on the documented allowlist.
- `truncation` is rejected.
- `previous_response_id` is forwarded when `conversation` is absent, but the `conversation + previous_response_id` conflict remains rejected.
- HTTP `/v1/responses` and HTTP `/backend-api/codex/responses` now use a server-side upstream websocket session bridge by default so repeated compatible requests can keep upstream response/session continuity without forcing clients onto the public websocket route.
- Codex-affinity HTTP bridge sessions can optionally use a conservative first-request prewarm (`generate=false`), but that behavior now stays behind an explicit flag so production defaults do not pay an extra upstream request unless operators opt in.
- When operators configure a multi-instance bridge ring, deterministic owner enforcement now applies only to hard continuity keys such as `x-codex-turn-state` and explicit session headers. Prompt-cache-derived bridge keys remain stable for local reuse, but in gateway-safe mode a non-owner replica may tolerate that locality miss and create or reuse a local session instead of failing with `bridge_instance_mismatch`.
- Codex-facing websocket routes now advertise `x-codex-turn-state` during websocket accept and honor client-provided turn-state on reconnect so routing can stay sticky at turn granularity even when the public websocket reconnects.
- HTTP responses routes now also return `x-codex-turn-state` headers so clients that persist response headers can promote later HTTP requests from prompt-cache affinity to stronger Codex-session continuity.
- `/v1/responses/compact` keeps a final-JSON contract and preserves the raw upstream `/codex/responses/compact` payload shape as the canonical next context window instead of rewriting it through buffered `/codex/responses` streaming.
- Compact transport failures fail closed with respect to semantics: no surrogate `/codex/responses` fallback and no local compact-window reconstruction.
- Compact transport may use bounded same-contract retries only for safe pre-body transport failures and `401 -> refresh -> retry`.
- `/v1/responses/compact` is supported only when the upstream implements it.
- `prompt_cache_key` affinity on OpenAI-style routes is intentionally bounded by a dashboard-managed freshness window, unlike durable backend `session_id` or dashboard sticky-thread routing.
- Codex-native direct websocket `/backend-api/codex/responses` treats upstream `previous_response_id` as an ephemeral anchor. If that anchor goes stale, the proxy masks raw upstream details and emits the sanitized canonical `previous_response_not_found` classifier so compatible Codex clients can retry with full local history and no `previous_response_id`. The upstream Codex socket has emitted this condition both with the canonical code and as a parameterless `invalid_request_error` carrying ``Invalid `previous_response_id`.``; both shapes use the same recovery policy.
- Upstream Responses WebSockets use transport ping/pong control frames to detect a black-holed connection without confusing valid application-event silence with an idle turn. Direct and routed connections reuse `proxy_downstream_websocket_idle_timeout_seconds` for this zero-config liveness budget.
- A post-send liveness timeout is delivery-ambiguous. It remains account-neutral, is never transparently replayed, and retires the affected upstream socket so a client retry opens a fresh route without risking duplicated model work or tool side effects.
- HTTP bridge settlement ownership is explicit: `closed` rejects new work but does not imply that a submitter owns existing siblings. Only a liveness-failed send claims whole-deque settlement under the lifecycle lock; otherwise the reader remains responsible for settling pending requests when the transport dies.

## Oversized downstream WebSocket HTTP fallback

The upstream Responses WebSocket has a frame budget that does not apply to the
upstream HTTP/SSE route. After historical slimming, codex-lb can move one
otherwise valid downstream WebSocket turn to upstream HTTP without changing the
client-facing event stream. This is deliberately narrower than a general
transport retry: the decision happens before upstream dispatch and admits only
an unanchored, conversation-free complete resend or a client-anchored input made
entirely of current tool outputs. Conversation-backed requests,
proxy-injected anchors, and anchored non-tool requests remain fail-closed.

The HTTP relay inherits the routing proof already established during WebSocket
request preparation. Previous-response ownership, session affinity, file-owner
pinning, admission, and API-key reservation settlement are transferred rather
than recomputed. A turn that produces `resp_A` over upstream HTTP records that
transport in the API-key/session-scoped owner cache and request log; an exact
continuation of `resp_A` stays on HTTP, while an unrelated response id and
legacy rows without transport provenance follow the ordinary WebSocket path.

For example, a complete resend containing several inline screenshots can
arrive without `previous_response_id` or `conversation`, exceed the final
projected WebSocket frame budget, and still deliver normal `response.created`,
delta, and terminal events to the same downstream socket through the HTTP
relay. A second unanchored resend cannot overtake that relay, and connection
cancellation targets the newest active turn.

Operationally, monitor `payload_too_large`, `stream_incomplete`, upstream
transport on WebSocket request logs, and reservation-settlement failures after
deployment. A rise in HTTP-upstream WebSocket turns is expected only for these
oversized bodies and exact continuations of their HTTP-created response ids.

## Fast Mode and Service Tiers

codex-lb accepts the OpenAI/Codex `service_tier` field on Responses and Chat
Completions compatible routes. The legacy `fast` spelling is accepted as an
alias and is forwarded upstream as the canonical `priority` tier.

Fast Mode is request-level intent, not a local speed guarantee. The upstream
Codex backend decides the actual tier for each completed response. codex-lb
therefore records three separate values in request logs:

- `requestedServiceTier`: what the client or API key asked for, after alias
  normalization.
- `actualServiceTier`: what upstream reported in the completed response, when
  upstream included it.
- `serviceTier`: the effective billable tier. This uses `actualServiceTier`
  when present and falls back to `requestedServiceTier` only when upstream omits
  the actual tier.

If a request is sent with `service_tier: "fast"` or `service_tier: "priority"`
and the completed row shows `requestedServiceTier: "priority"` but
`actualServiceTier: "default"`, codex-lb forwarded the priority request and
upstream chose the default tier. That can happen even when websocket transport
is active.

For OpenCode or Codex-compatible clients, enable Fast Mode by sending a
Responses request with:

```json
{
  "service_tier": "priority"
}
```

Clients that expose Fast Mode as `fast` may keep using that spelling; codex-lb
normalizes it to `priority` before forwarding.

### Operator Fast Mode prohibition

Operators can enable the Routing setting `prohibitFastMode` when qualified
Codex harness model aliases such as `gpt-5.6-sol-xhigh-fast` must run at the
normal OpenAI tier. The alias still supplies its canonical model and reasoning
effort, but does not derive `service_tier: "priority"`. This policy does not
rewrite an explicit client tier or an API-key-enforced tier; see
`openspec/specs/fast-mode-policy/context.md` for scope and operating notes.

API keys can also force the tier for traffic that uses that key. Set the key's
enforced service tier to `priority` or `fast`; both values are stored and
returned as `priority`.

To verify a completed Fast Mode request:

1. `Transport` should be `WS` if you are verifying the websocket Codex path.
2. `requestedServiceTier` should be `priority` when the client requested Fast
   Mode or the API key enforced it.
3. `actualServiceTier` is the upstream result. `default` means upstream did not
   grant priority for that response.

This distinction matters for quota and cost accounting: codex-lb prices the
request from the effective billable `serviceTier`, not from the requested tier
when upstream reports a different actual tier.

## Include Allowlist (Reference)

- `code_interpreter_call.outputs`
- `computer_call_output.output.image_url`
- `file_search_call.results`
- `message.input_image.image_url`
- `message.output_text.logprobs`
- `reasoning.encrypted_content`
- `web_search_call.action.sources`

## Failure Modes

- **Stream ends without terminal event:** Emit `response.failed` with `stream_incomplete`.
- **Upstream error / no accounts:** Non-streaming responses return an OpenAI error envelope with 5xx status.
- **Compact upstream transport/client failure:** Retry only inside `/codex/responses/compact` when the failure is safely retryable; otherwise return an explicit upstream error without surrogate fallback.
- **HTTP bridge session closes or expires:** The next compatible HTTP `/v1/responses` or `/backend-api/codex/responses` request recreates a fresh upstream websocket bridge session; continuity is guaranteed only within the lifetime of one active bridged session.
- **Multi-instance routing without bridge owner policy:** if operators do not configure a bridge ring or front-door affinity, continuity can still fragment across replicas. With a configured bridge ring, hard continuity keys landing on a non-owner replica are proxy-forwarded to the owner replica; the proxy fails closed only when the owner endpoint or ring membership cannot be resolved or the forward signature fails authentication. Gateway-safe prompt-cache requests may accept locality misses and continue locally instead of forwarding.
- **Codex websocket reconnects:** Reconnect continuity now depends on the client replaying the accepted `x-codex-turn-state`; generated turn-state is emitted on accept for backend Codex routes and echoed back when the client already supplies one.
- **Codex websocket stale previous-response anchors:** Direct backend Codex websocket stale-anchor failures are either replayed transparently from a self-contained full resend or surfaced as a sanitized `response.failed` whose `response.error.code` is `previous_response_not_found`; the error omits `param`, the raw upstream envelope, and the missing `resp_...` id. A connect-time failure uses the same code directly at `error.code`. This includes the parameterless upstream message ``Invalid `previous_response_id`.``. OpenAI-compatible `/v1/responses` websocket clients continue to receive generic `stream_incomplete` masking.
- **Websocket handshake forbidden/not-found:** Auto transport now fails loud on `403` / `404` instead of silently hiding the websocket regression behind HTTP fallback.
- **Upstream websocket stops answering pings:** Pending direct-WebSocket and HTTP-bridge work fails with `upstream_websocket_liveness_timeout`; the account remains healthy and the request is not replayed because upstream acceptance is unknown.
- **Invalid request payloads:** Return 4xx with `invalid_request_error`.

## Error Envelope Mapping (Reference)

- 401 → `invalid_api_key`
- 403 → `insufficient_permissions`
- 404 → `not_found`
- 429 → `rate_limit_exceeded`
- 5xx → `server_error`

## Examples

Non-streaming request/response:

```json
// request
{ "model": "gpt-5.1", "input": "hi" }
```

```json
// response
{ "id": "resp_123", "object": "response", "status": "completed", "output": [] }
```

Cursor-style model alias request:

```json
{ "model": "gpt-5.4-mini-high", "input": "hi" }
```

This forwards upstream as `model: "gpt-5.4-mini"` with `reasoning.effort: "high"`.

Retry-circuit accounting example: an idle bridge closes with `pending=0`, then
the next request times out before `response.created`. The idle close is logged
but contributes no failure; the timeout is the first strike. Only another
consecutive eventless pending failure may open the repeated-failure cooldown.

Stale-anchor recovery example: a reconnect sends a tool-output delta with a
recent `previous_response_id`, and upstream answers
``{"type":"error","status":400,"error":{"type":"invalid_request_error","message":"Invalid `previous_response_id`."}}``.
Because the delta cannot stand alone, codex-lb returns a sanitized
`previous_response_not_found` signal on the Codex-native route so the client can
retry once with full local history. If the original request already contained a
self-contained full resend, codex-lb instead reconnects and replays that body
without the rejected anchor.

## Known Client Integrations (Reference)

Third-party agents that consume the `/v1` Responses surface documented by this
capability (rendered guide: `docs/client-setup.md`). These are configuration
examples against the existing contract, not separate compatibility surfaces:

- **OpenCode** — built-in `openai` provider with a `baseURL` override; uses the
  Responses API path so `encrypted_content` / multi-turn reasoning state is
  preserved (Chat Completions custom providers drop it).
- **OpenClaw** — custom provider with `"api": "openai-responses"` against
  `/v1`; Codex-native provider builds may target `/backend-api/codex` instead.
- **Hermes Agent** (Nous Research) — named custom provider with
  `api_mode: codex_responses` against `/v1`; the responses transport carries
  reasoning state across turns like the OpenCode path.

New client guides added to `docs/client-setup.md` should stay configuration-only
examples of this contract; anything needing new proxy behavior requires its own
OpenSpec change first.

## Operational Notes

- Pre-release: run unit/integration tests and optional OpenAI client compatibility tests.
- Smoke tests: stream a response, validate non-stream responses, and verify error envelopes.
- Post-deploy: monitor `no_accounts`, `upstream_unavailable`, compact retry attempts, and compact failure phases, especially on direct compact requests.
- Post-deploy: monitor HTTP bridge reuse/create/evict/reconnect counts and any `previous_response_not_found` or queue-saturation errors on `/v1/responses` and `/backend-api/codex/responses`.
- Post-deploy: monitor `capacity_exhausted_active_sessions`, Codex-session bridge reuse/evict counts, websocket handshake 403/404 rates after the narrower auto-fallback policy, and backend Codex HTTP vs websocket cache-ratio gaps.
- When tracing compact incidents, confirm that request logs and upstream logs show direct `/codex/responses/compact` usage without surrogate `/codex/responses` fallback.
- Post-deploy: monitor `no_accounts`, `stream_incomplete`, and `upstream_unavailable`.
- Post-deploy: monitor `upstream_websocket_liveness_timeout`; recurring failures indicate a host route, VPN, proxy, or intermediary that black-holes established WebSockets.
- Post-deploy: correlate retry-circuit `opened`, `half_open`, and `reset` events with bridge `pending` and `response_events_seen` diagnostics. An idle `pending=0` retirement must not precede an immediate two-failure cooldown.
- Post-deploy: monitor `previous_response_not_found` on `/backend-api/codex/responses`; recurring spikes show repeated continuity failures, which may come from malformed client identifiers, server-side invalidation, or connection lifecycle. Clients should perform the documented full-context retry without `previous_response_id`. Investigate socket-lifecycle remediation only when a separate close-reason, reconnect, or transport diagnostic correlates with the failures.
